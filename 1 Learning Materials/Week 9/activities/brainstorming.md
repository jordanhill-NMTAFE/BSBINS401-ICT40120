# BRAINSTORMING ACTIVITY SHEET  
*(No Deliverables Required – This is for Your Own Planning)*

## 1. YOUR AREA OF INTEREST  
- List 2–3 broad topics or fields you genuinely care about (e.g., health, finance, sustainability, education, tech, arts).  
- Why do these appeal to you? (Personal experience, career goals, curiosity, etc.)  
- Jot down keywords or phrases related to each topic.  

## 2. IDENTIFY A PROBLEM OR QUESTION  
- For each topic, think of a single key question or problem that sparks your curiosity.  
  - Example: "How does social media usage correlate with student performance?"  
- Note any potential sub-questions.  
  - Example: "Does usage differ by age or field of study?"  

## 3. POTENTIAL DATA & ITS SOURCES  
- Brainstorm possible data you might need to explore these questions.  
  - Public datasets from Kaggle or government portals?  
  - Company records or open-source data?  
- Consider the feasibility of obtaining this data.  
  - Is it freely available? Are there licenses or privacy constraints?  

## 4. RESEARCH APPROACH & METHODS  
- Sketch out how you might investigate each question.  
  - Would you analyze existing datasets or conduct a survey?  
  - Might you do interviews or observations?  
- Consider what tools or skills might be relevant (e.g., Excel, Python, R, Google Sheets, survey platforms).  

## 5. SCOPING & PRACTICALITY  
- Timeframe: How long do you have to conduct this research?  
- Resources: Do you have access to the necessary technology, data, or skills?  
- Constraints: Note any factors like sample size, data availability, or ethical considerations.  

## 6. FREE-FORM NOTES & IDEAS  
- Use this space to jot down any "Aha!" moments, lingering worries, or interesting tangents.  
  - Is there a recent news article or study that inspired you?  
  - Are there potential collaborators or experts you might consult?  

## 7. REFLECTION & NARROWING DOWN  
- Review your notes from steps 1–6.  
- Which idea still feels the most doable and exciting?  
- If you need to refine the scope, how might you make it more specific or manageable?  

## NEXT STEPS  
1. Choose your top idea to move forward with.  
2. Flesh out an informal plan or outline.  
3. Remember: You do not need to submit these notes or ideas to your lecturer. This worksheet is solely to help you think through your proposal.
