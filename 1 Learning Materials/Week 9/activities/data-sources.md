# DATA SOURCE EVALUATION ACTIVITY SHEET
*Use This Guide to Critically Assess Potential Datasets*

## INTRODUCTION: WHY EVALUATE DATA SOURCES?
- **Accuracy & Reliability**: Ensures your research findings are credible.
- **Ethical & Legal Compliance**: Respects data privacy, usage licenses, and relevant regulations.
- **Relevance & Timeliness**: Data should suit your research objectives and be sufficiently recent.
- **Completeness & Quality**: Minimizes issues related to missing or inconsistent data.

## PROCESS GUIDE: STEP-BY-STEP EVALUATION

### 1) CLARIFY YOUR RESEARCH NEEDS
- Clearly define your research question or objective.
- Determine what kind of data you require (variables, time period, level of detail).

### 2) LOCATE POTENTIAL DATA SOURCES
- Explore portals like Kaggle, government websites, or institutional repositories.
- Identify at least two candidate datasets for comparison.

### 3) APPLY THE DATA SOURCE EVALUATION CHECKLIST
#### A. RELIABILITY
- Is the source reputable (e.g., government site, recognized research institution)?
- Is there any peer review or external validation?

#### B. COMPLETENESS
- Do you have enough records or data points to answer your question?
- Are crucial data fields missing?

#### C. TIMELINESS & RELEVANCE
- How current is the data?
- Does it align with your research timeframe (e.g., last five years)?

#### D. FORMAT & ACCESSIBILITY
- Is the data in a workable format (CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON)?
- Are there licensing or permission barriers?

#### E. ETHICAL & LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS
- Does the data contain personally identifiable information?
- Are there any usage restrictions (commercial vs. non-commercial)?

### 4) DOCUMENT YOUR FINDINGS
- For each dataset, record strengths and weaknesses according to the checklist.
- Note any red flags (e.g., large amounts of missing data, unclear source).
- Keep references (URLs, publication dates, authors).

### 5) COMPARE & SELECT
- Compare your documented notes across datasets.
- Choose the dataset that best meets your research needs, or combine multiple if that's beneficial.

### 6) DECIDE ON NEXT STEPS
- If the dataset is sufficient: proceed to data cleaning and analysis.
- If not: revisit your search, adjust your selection criteria, or refine your research scope.

## DISCUSSION PROMPTS
1. How might the dataset's level of completeness affect the accuracy of your final analysis?
2. Could there be ethical concerns in using the data (e.g., privacy, informed consent)?
3. In what ways do you see data accessibility influencing your research timeline and costs?
4. What steps would you take if you discover the data's source is questionable or unclear?

## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
- Select two potential datasets relevant to your current or upcoming project.
- Complete the checklist for each, noting pros and cons.
- Share your findings in small groups or a short discussion post:
  - Which dataset scored higher overall, and why?
  - Did this process reveal any unexpected issues or benefits?
