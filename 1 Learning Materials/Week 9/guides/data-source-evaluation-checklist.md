DATA SOURCE EVALUATION CHECKLIST
=================================

Use this checklist to quickly assess the suitability and quality of a dataset for your research.

1. SOURCE RELIABILITY  
   - Who published or provided the data (e.g., government agency, research institution, private company)?  
   - Is the source reputable and free from conflicts of interest?  
   - Are there references, citations, or verifications confirming data authenticity?

2. RELEVANCE TO YOUR RESEARCH  
   - Does the dataset clearly relate to your research question or objectives?  
   - Are the variables or features included relevant to the analysis you want to conduct?  
   - Will the dataset meaningfully contribute to your findings?

3. COMPLETENESS & COVERAGE  
   - Is there enough data (number of rows, range of dates, size of sample) to draw reliable conclusions?  
   - How many missing or null values are there in key variables?  
   - Are important categories, demographic groups, or time periods underrepresented?

4. DATA FORMAT & ACCESSIBILITY  
   - In what format does the data come (CSV, JSON, Excel, SQL, etc.)?  
   - Is it easily readable and importable into your chosen tool(s)?  
   - Do you have permission or licensing rights to use the data?

5. DOCUMENTATION & METADATA  
   - Is there a data dictionary or description of how variables were collected?  
   - Are measurement units, categories, or coding conventions clearly explained?  
   - Can you find any information about who collected the data and when?

6. TIMELINESS & VALIDITY  
   - When was the data collected or last updated?  
   - Is it current enough to be relevant for your topic?  
   - Could older data limit the accuracy or applicability of your findings?

7. ETHICAL & LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS  
   - Does the dataset contain personally identifiable information (PII)?  
   - Have privacy or data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) been respected?  
   - If sensitive data are involved, is there a consent mechanism or usage policy you must follow?

8. POTENTIAL BIASES  
   - How was the data collected (surveys, automated logs, convenience sampling)?  
   - Could the collection method exclude or over-represent certain populations?  
   - Are there any known biases or limitations declared by the data provider?

9. DATA QUALITY & ACCURACY  
   - Have there been any known issues with data errors, duplicates, or outliers?  
   - Does the dataset undergo a cleaning process or quality checks?  
   - Are definitions consistent across the entire dataset?

10. SUPPORT & COMMUNITY FEEDBACK  
   - Is there a support forum or contact person available if you have questions?  
   - Have other researchers used this dataset (look for reviews, discussions, or citations)?  
   - Are there open issues or bugs noted by users that remain unresolved?

HOW TO USE THIS CHECKLIST  
--------------------------
• Go through each section before you commit to using a dataset in your research.  
• If you encounter red flags (e.g., lots of missing data or questionable source reliability), consider looking for alternative data or adjusting your approach.  
• Document your findings or concerns for transparency in your methodology.
