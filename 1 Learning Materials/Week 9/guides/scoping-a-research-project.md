# Guide to Scoping a Research Project

Scoping a research project involves defining your topic clearly and planning how to investigate it. Below is a simple step-by-step guide to help you scope your research effectively.

## 1. Clarify Your Purpose
- Ask yourself: "What is the main goal of my research?"  
- Focus on one central problem or question you want to answer.  
- Keep it clear and specific (e.g., "What factors influence employee attrition in a retail company?").

## 2. Narrow Your Topic
- If your topic is too broad—like "technology in business"—it becomes harder to explore deeply.  
- Zoom in on a specific area (e.g., "customer satisfaction with mobile apps" rather than "technology in business").  
- A more focused topic helps you stay on track and avoid information overload.

## 3. Know Your Constraints
- Time, resources, and access to data can limit how much you can do.  
- Be realistic about how long you have to complete the research and what data or tools you can reasonably obtain.  
- Early awareness of constraints helps you tailor a manageable scope.

## 4. Identify Potential Data Sources
- Start by listing where you might get information: public datasets, interviews, surveys, academic journals, or company records.  
- Evaluate each source for reliability, relevance, and permission/ethics requirements (e.g., do you have consent for personal data?).  
- Make sure your data sources align with your research question.

## 5. Outline Your Methodology
- Decide which methods best suit your question (e.g., statistical analysis, interviews, surveys, experiments).  
- Be clear about what you will measure, how you will measure it, and which tools you'll use (e.g., Python, Excel, SPSS).  
- Consider at least a basic timeline: when you'll gather data and when you'll analyze it.

## 6. Consider Ethical and Privacy Issues
- If working with human data, ensure you respect confidentiality and privacy laws.  
- Double-check licenses for any dataset you plan to use.  
- Document how you will manage or anonymize sensitive information.

## 7. Set a Clear Plan and Timeline
- Break down the project into stages: data gathering, analysis, drafting, revising, etc.  
- Assign target dates to each stage to keep yourself on schedule.  
- Revisiting and adjusting timelines is normal—just make sure you stay realistic.

## 8. Review Feasibility and Adjust Where Needed
- After outlining your plan, review everything as a whole.  
- Is the topic still too big? Can you actually gather the data you need in your timeline?  
- Revise your scope if you find mismatches between your ambitions and the reality of available resources.

## 9. Communicate Your Scope
- Clearly state your project's scope in your proposal or introduction.  
- Let readers know what you'll cover and what falls outside your research boundaries.  
- This clarity prevents confusion and sets expectations for your final report.

## Conclusion
Scoping your research project well is about being realistic and specific. By clarifying your goal, knowing what resources and time you have, picking the right data sources, and planning carefully, you set yourself up for a more focused and successful study. A well-scoped project allows you to dive deeper, making your final findings more useful and reliable.
