## Cloud Credits for Education

##### Why Google?: Google Cloud is the backbone of Kaggle— so if we can get some credits it will give us some extra flexibility with running our workloads.

#### Why AWS?: AWS has a number of great integrations with the open source AI & Machine learning community. For example, Huggingface, via AWS SageMaker.

#### Why Azure?: Azure has a number of great integrations with the open source AI & Machine learning community. For example, Huggingface, via Azure ML.


#### These three are the major players when it comes to AI & cloud computing. If you continue in this field you will likely need some form of support from these providers.
