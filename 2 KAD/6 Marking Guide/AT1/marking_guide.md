  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv('employee_attrition.csv')
  ```

- **Data Cleaning**:

  - **Handled Missing Values**: Identified and addressed missing data using `df.isnull().sum()` and imputed or dropped as appropriate.
  - **Data Types**: Ensured all variables had correct data types for analysis (e.g., converting "Age" to integer).

### Task 3: Analyze Data and Draw Conclusions

#### **Notes to the Marker**

- **Key Points to Assess**:
  - Use of appropriate data analysis techniques to address research objectives.
  - Identification of key themes, patterns, or trends.
  - Conclusions are clear, justified, and supported by evidence from the analysis.
  - Assumptions made are explicitly stated and reasonable.

- **Relation to BSBINS401**:

  - **Critical Thinking**: Evaluates information to form conclusions.

#### **Example Response**

**Data Analysis and Findings**

- **Analysis Methods**:

  - **Correlation Analysis**: Computed correlation coefficients between employee satisfaction scores and attrition rates.
  
    ```python
    corr = df['SatisfactionScore'].corr(df['Attrition'])
    ```
  
  - **Visualization**: Generated a heatmap to visualize correlations and bar charts to compare attrition rates across departments.

- **Key Findings**:

  - **Finding 1**: There is a strong negative correlation (-0.68) between employee satisfaction scores and attrition, indicating that lower satisfaction is associated with higher attrition.
  - **Finding 2**: Departments such as Sales and Customer Service have higher attrition rates compared to others.

- **Conclusions**:

  - **Conclusion 1**: Enhancing employee satisfaction could significantly reduce attrition rates.
  - **Conclusion 2**: Targeted interventions in high-attrition departments may be necessary.

- **Assumptions**:

  - Assumed that the satisfaction scores are an accurate reflection of employee sentiment.
  - Assumed that the data is representative of the entire organization.
