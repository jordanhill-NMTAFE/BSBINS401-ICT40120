**Templates**: Research proposal template, final report template, and presentation guidelines available on the LMS.

**Supplementary Materials**: Access to course readings, tutorials, and additional references.

**Organisational Policies and Procedures**: Provided on the LMS, including data security policies.

# Assessment Instructions

### Scenario

You are acting as a data analyst for an organisation or industry sector of your choice. You have been asked to conduct a comprehensive research project to address specific business questions or challenges. You will independently identify a dataset, develop research objectives, analyse the data, and present your findings in a professional report and presentation.

### Instructions

You are required to:

**Identify Research Objectives and Develop Research Strategy**:
   
1. Choose a topic and identify a problem or opportunity relevant to an organisation or industry sector.

2. Identify potential sources for research information (datasets) relevant to your objectives.

3. Assess the reliability of potential data sources.

4. Confirm that your research strategy is appropriate and relevant to your research objectives.

**Collect and Store Research Information**:
   
1. Access and extract relevant information from the selected dataset.

2. Organise the data in a format suitable for analysis and distribution.

3. Store the research information securely, adhering to organisational policies and procedures.

**Analyse Information and Synthesise Findings**:
    
1. Analyse the stored information according to your research strategy.

2. Identify themes and draw conclusions based on your analysis.

3. Ensure that assumptions and conclusions are clear, justified, supported by evidence, and consistent with your research strategy.

**Prepare the Final Report**:
   
1. Identify methods of reporting that align with the intended audience and organisational requirements.

2. Draft the research report, including all required sections and visualisations.

3. Facilitate review of the draft report according to organisational policies and procedures.

**Present Research Information and Obtain Feedback**:
   
1. Prepare and deliver a presentation summarising your research objectives, methodology, findings, and conclusions.

2. Distribute the final report according to organisational policies and procedures.

3. Obtain feedback and comments on the suitability and sufficiency of your findings in accordance with organisational requirements.

### Submission Evidence

You are required to submit the following evidence:

- **Research Proposal**: Submit a research proposal outlining your project plan (submitted earlier in Week 10).

- **Final Report**: Submit a comprehensive final report (1,000–2,000 words) via the LMS by the due date (Week 16).

- **Presentation Slides**: Upload your presentation slides to the LMS after your presentation.

- **Observation Checklist**: Your instructor will complete the observation checklist during your presentation. **In-Class Presentation**: Deliver a 15-minute presentation during the Week 16 class session.

## Assessment 2: Independent Research Project Final Report and Presentation

### Task 1: Identify Research Objectives and Develop Research Strategy

#### Instructions

#### Task 1: Identify Research Objectives and Develop Research Strategy

Begin by choosing a research topic relevant to an organisation or industry sector. Define at least two specific research objectives that address a problem or opportunity. Research and identify potential datasets or information sources that align with your objectives, and evaluate their quality and reliability—considering factors such as accuracy, authority, relevance, and likelihood of bias. Develop and confirm a research strategy that is appropriate for your objectives, making use of common research approaches.

**Response Requirements:**  

For this task, submit a research proposal that includes:

- An introduction and background to your topic
- Clearly stated research objectives
- A summary of proposed data sources and your assessment of their reliability
- An outline of your research strategy


---

### Task 2: Collect and Store Research Information

**Instructions:**  
Access your selected dataset(s) and collect relevant information in a format suitable for analysis. Organise the data effectively (for example, using dataframes in Pandas), and ensure it is stored securely in line with organisational policies and security requirements.

**Response Requirements:**  
In your report, include a "Data Collection and Storage" section that explains how you accessed and collected the data, how you organised it for analysis, and what security measures you used to store it. Add any relevant code snippets or methods in the appendices.

---

### Task 3: Analyse Information and Synthesise Findings

**Instructions:**  
Analyse your data using appropriate methods and tools, ensuring your approach is efficient and reliable. Identify significant themes, patterns, or trends, and develop conclusions that are justified, evidence-based, and consistent with your research strategy. Clearly state any assumptions made during your analysis.

**Response Requirements:**  
Your report should contain a comprehensive "Data Analysis and Findings" section, presenting your analysis with visualisations and explanations, discussing identified themes and patterns, and justifying your conclusions with evidence. Include detailed code and methodologies in the appendices.

---

### Task 4: Prepare the Final Report

**Instructions:**  
Follow the professional report structure provided in the templates, ensuring all required sections are included: executive summary, introduction, methodology, analysis, conclusions, recommendations, references, and appendices. Seek feedback on your draft report according to organisational policies and revise it based on the feedback received.

**Response Requirements:**  
Submit a polished final report (1,000–2,000 words) that demonstrates professional writing, formatting, and presentation, and adheres to organisational policies on the form and content of research reports. Submit the final report via the LMS by the due date.

---

### Task 5: Present Research Information and Obtain Feedback

**Instructions:**  
Develop a presentation that effectively summarises your research project, using visual aids and storytelling techniques to engage your audience. Present your findings to the class in a 15-minute session, encourage questions and discussion, and gather feedback on the suitability and sufficiency of your findings.

**Response Requirements:**  
- Submit your presentation slides via the LMS prior to presenting.
- Deliver your presentation during the scheduled session.
- After your presentation, include a "Feedback and Reflection" section in your report summarising the feedback received and your own reflections.
- Your instructor will assess your presentation using the observation checklist.
