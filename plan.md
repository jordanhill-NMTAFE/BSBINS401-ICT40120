# Development Plan

## **Course Structure**

1. **First Cycle**: Students will work with a standard dataset provided by you. They will conduct research, analyze the data, and present their findings.

2. **Second Cycle**: In the next semester, students will scope their own research projects, find or collect their own datasets, and repeat the cycle independently.

3. **Final exam**: Students will demonstrate their understanding of research principles and methodologies through an in-class exam, open book.

This approach aligns with the unit's performance evidence requirement of demonstrating the skills on at least two occasions.
