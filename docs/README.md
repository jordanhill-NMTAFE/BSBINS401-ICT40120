## Introduction

Welcome to the **BSBINS401 - Analyse and Present Research Information** unit at North Metropolitan TAFE! This course is designed to introduce you to data visualization tools and techniques using Python. Throughout this unit, you will develop the skills to analyze research information and present your findings effectively.

## Course Overview

In this unit, you will:

- **Identify research requirements and objectives**.
- **Collect, organize, and present research information**.
- **Maintain information securely according to policies**.
- **Prepare and produce research reports**.

The course will be delivered over **18 weeks**, combining face-to-face sessions and practical exercises. We will utilize various tools such as Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Kaggle, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries to explore data visualization and analysis.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Understand and define research strategies.
- Collect and store research information effectively.
- Analyze and synthesize research data.
- Present research findings through reports and presentations.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into two main cycles:

1. **First Cycle (Weeks 1-7)**:
   - Work with a standard dataset provided.
   - Conduct research, analyze data, and present your findings.
   - Complete **Assessment 1**: Research and Presentation on Standard Dataset.

2. **Second Cycle (Weeks 8-16)**:
   - Scope and conduct your own independent research project.
   - Find or collect your own dataset.
   - Complete **Assessment 2**: Independent Research Project and Presentation.

The course concludes with **Assessment 3**: an **In-Class Open Book Exam** in Week 17.
