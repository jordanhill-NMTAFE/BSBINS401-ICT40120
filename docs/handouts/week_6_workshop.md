# Workshop Handout: Structuring Your Assessment 1 Report

This workshop guides you through organizing and drafting a clear, cohesive report for Assessment 1. By the end, you'll have a structured outline, detailed sections, and a plan to ensure your report meets the unit requirements.

---

## Workshop Objectives

1. Clarify the necessary sections of your assessment report.  
2. Practice formulating a strong introduction, methodology, and findings.  
3. Explore strategies for incorporating tables, charts, and supporting arguments.  
4. Develop a concise conclusion and recommendations section.

---

## Recommended Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic data exploration and visualization.  
- Preliminary analysis or data findings from the standard dataset.  
- Access to your draft notes or Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Materials Needed

- A sample dataset or initial findings you’ve generated.  
- Laptop or access to a computer (with your files/project available).  
- Note-taking materials (digital or paper).

## Workshop Outline

### 1. Introduction (15 minutes)

**Purpose**: Establish the relevance and context of your research.

1. **Identify Your Research Objective**  
   - Summarize the main goals or questions guiding your analysis (e.g., “Investigate factors influencing employee attrition…”).

2. **Context and Rationale**  
   - Provide background information.  
   - Explain why your chosen aspect or question matters and to whom.

3. **Scope and Limitations**  
   - State the boundaries of your study (e.g., dataset size, time period).  
   - Note any constraints or assumptions.

> **Activity**: In pairs, share your draft introductions or your initial ideas. Offer each other 1-2 suggestions on how to clarify the objectives or strengthen the relevance.

### 2. Methodology (20 minutes)

**Purpose**: Describe how you conducted your analysis, including data collection, cleaning, and visualization.

1. **Data Description**  
   - Outline where your dataset came from (e.g., Kaggle or provided file).  
   - Note key data features (number of records, types of columns).

2. **Cleaning and Preparation**  
   - Explain steps taken to handle missing data or anomalies.  
   - Justify why you made certain transformations (e.g., dropping outliers, normalizing values).

3. **Tools and Techniques**  
   - List software/libraries used (e.g., Python, Pandas, Seaborn).  
   - Mention specific methods for analysis, like correlation analysis or pivot tables.

> **Activity**: Small group discussion. Each participant sketches a flowchart showing their data process, from original dataset → cleaning → final analysis. Pin these flowcharts on the board for feedback.

### 3. Analysis & Findings (30 minutes)

**Purpose**: Present your data-driven insights with appropriate visuals.

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Summarize key statistical insights (mean, median, standard deviation) or patterns found.  
   - Use appropriate charts or tables to illustrate significant trends (keep it clear and uncluttered).

2. **Visual Evidence**  
   - Insert 2-3 core figures that best reflect important findings.  
   - Label axes clearly, add a descriptive title, and reference each figure in the text.

3. **Interpreting Results**  
   - Connect insights back to your research objectives.  
   - Discuss potential reasons behind patterns or correlations.

> **Activity**: Individually, select one significant finding from your analysis. Write a short paragraph describing the finding and why it is important, then attach the corresponding chart or table. Share in trios to refine clarity and relevance.

---

### 4. Conclusions & Recommendations (15 minutes)

**Purpose**: Wrap up the report with clear takeaways and potential actions.

1. **Summarize Key Points**  
   - Recap main findings in a concise manner.

2. **Address Research Questions**  
   - Revisit your initial objectives to confirm what has been answered (and what remains open).

3. **Recommendations**  
   - Suggest possible next steps or further investigations.  
   - Highlight any real-world applications or implications of the data insights.

> **Activity**: As a group, brainstorm possible recommendations that could stem from typical findings (e.g., “Implement an employee satisfaction survey,” “Streamline data collection processes”). Jot down ideas even if they are broad—this exercise helps refine the conclusion’s actionability.

---

### 5. References & Appendices (10 minutes)

**Purpose**: Provide credit for data sources and include supplementary materials.

1. **References**  
   - Use a consistent citation style (e.g., Harvard, APA).  
   - Cite data sources, articles, and any external resources referenced in the report.

2. **Appendices**  
   - Place extended tables, additional charts, or non-critical code snippets here.  
   - Keep your main report concise by delegating secondary materials to appendices.

> **Pro Tip**: Draft references as you go (it’s easy to forget sources otherwise). If your code or data cleaning steps are too lengthy, note them in an appendix to maintain the report’s flow.

---

## Putting It All Together

1. **Review for Flow**: Check that each section logically leads to the next (Introduction → Methodology → Findings → Conclusions).  
2. **Refine Visuals**: Ensure each figure or table has a title and is referenced in the text.  
3. **Proofread**: Eliminate typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistent formatting.  
4. **Solicit Feedback**: Share a draft with a peer or tutor for review before final submission.
