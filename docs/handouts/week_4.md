# Handout: Formulating Your Research Question

---

## Introduction

A well-crafted research question is the foundation of any successful research project. It directs your analysis, guides your data exploration, and sets clear goals for your work. In this handout, we'll walk through how to develop strong research questions tailored to your chosen dataset. By the end of this exercise, you should have 2-3 specific research questions that will shape your investigation.

## Why is a Good Research Question Important?

- **Focus Your Analysis:** It narrows down your investigation to key aspects of your data.
- **Guide Data Exploration:** A clear question helps you identify which data points and variables are most relevant.
- **Drive Methodology:** It informs the analytical tools and techniques you choose.
- **Communicate Your Intent:** A solid question helps your audience understand the significance and direction of your research.

## Steps to Formulate a Research Question

### 1. Understand Your Dataset
- **Review the Dataset Overview:**  
  Look over the dataset to understand its key features, variables, and overall structure.
- **Identify the Context:**  
  Reflect on the domain (e.g., HR, education, healthcare). What problems are common in this area?
- **Note Interesting Trends:**  
  As you explore, jot down any surprising aspects, trends, or anomalies.

### 2. Brainstorm Ideas
- **List Potential Topics:**  
  Write down areas of interest related to your dataset. For example, if the dataset involves employee attrition, consider factors like satisfaction levels, department differences, or work environment.
- **Ask "What if" Questions:**  
  Develop curiosity-driven ideas. E.g., "What if there is a correlation between department size and attrition rate?" or "What factors might contribute to employee satisfaction?"

### 3. Refine Your Ideas into Questions
- **Make Them Specific:**  
  Replace vague ideas with targeted questions. Instead of "What affects employee attrition?" try "How does department type influence employee attrition rates?"
- **Ensure They Are Answerable:**  
  Your questions should be supported by the data available. Verify that relevant variables exist.
- **Focus on Clarity and Relevance:**  
  Use clear language and ensure the question is directly tied to the research objectives of your project.

### 4. Review Examples of Well-Formed Research Questions

- *Example 1:* "How does the level of job satisfaction correlate with employee attrition rates across different departments?"
- *Example 2:* "What role does employee tenure play in predicting performance scores within the company?"
- *Example 3:* "In what ways does departmental diversity impact the frequency of internal promotions?"

## Tips for Success

- **Be Concise:** Each question and explanation should be direct and focused.
- **Be Specific:** Avoid vague or overly broad statements.
- **Consider Feasibility:** Ensure that your questions can be answered with the data you have.
- **Seek Feedback:** If possible, discuss your initial ideas with a peer or the instructor before finalizing.
